# Authoring commands (`arcane_tooling`)

Every command is a name plus JSON arguments, run against an open
`ProjectContext` through `CommandRegistry::execute`. The library has no GUI
dependency. The `arcane` CLI (AF4) and the editor (AF5) are meant to call
the same registry; neither does yet, so today the commands are reachable from
C++ and `tests/test_tooling_commands.cpp` only.

## Project context

`ProjectContext::open(dir, module_override)` registers builtin component
types, loads the project's native module (or `module_override`) and registers
its types, then reads the main scene, in that order. The scene is read
strictly: unknown component types or properties, or a missing module, fail the
open and nothing is written. The module stays loaded until the context is
destroyed; the scene and registry are destroyed first. Do not keep node,
component or descriptor pointers beyond the context.

`save()` writes the scene file only (serialized first, replaced atomically,
old file kept on failure) and fails with `CONFLICT` if the file changed on disk
since it was read or last saved.

## Execution

`execute(context, {command, args}, {persist, dry_run})`:

- arguments are checked against the command's schema (`ARGS_INVALID`);
- a mutating command returns `inverse`, the invocation that restores the
  previous state (absent when nothing changed);
- `persist` saves after the command and restores memory if saving fails;
  `dry_run` runs and then restores memory, writing nothing;
- a failed command leaves memory and disk unchanged.

`CommandHistory` records forward/inverse pairs for undo/redo (the GUI model;
the CLI persists immediately and keeps no history).

## Selectors

Node: `id:42` or `path:/Root/Player` (each name must be unique at its level).
Component: an integer component id, or a type name attached exactly once.

## Commands

| Command | Arguments | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prop.list` | `node`, `component` | `{component_id, type, properties:[{name,type,value}]}` |
| `prop.get` | `node`, `component`, `name` | `{name, type, value}` |
| `prop.set` (mutating) | `node`, `component`, `name`, `value` | `{changed, previous, value}` |

Values use the scene encodings (`docs/formats/scene.md`): bool, 32-bit int,
finite binary32 float, `[x,y]`, `[r,g,b,a]`, string, unsigned id. `entity_id`
values must be 0 or an existing node.

## Errors

`{"ok":false,"error":{"code","message","file","path","hint"}}`, absent fields
null. Exit status for the CLI:

| Code | Exit |
| --- | --- |
| `UNKNOWN_COMMAND`, `ARGS_INVALID`, `USAGE` | 2 |
| `PROJECT_NOT_FOUND`, `IO_ERROR` | 3 |
| `SCHEMA_INVALID`, `VALUE_INVALID`, `PROPERTY_UNKNOWN`, `NODE_NOT_FOUND`, `COMPONENT_NOT_FOUND`, `COMPONENT_TYPE_UNKNOWN` | 4 |
| `SELECTOR_AMBIGUOUS`, `CONFLICT` | 5 |
| `MODULE_LOAD_FAILED`, `MODULE_FAILURE` | 6 |
| `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION` | 7 |
